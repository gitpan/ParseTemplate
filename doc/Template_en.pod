=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Parse::Template> class evaluates Perl expressions
placed within a text.  This class can be used as a code generator,
or a generator of documents in various document formats (HTML, XML,
RTF, etc.).

The principle of template-based text generation is simple.  A template
consists of a text which includes expressions to be evaluated.
Interpretation of these expressions generates text fragments which are
substituted in place of the expressions.  In the case of
C<Parse::Template> the expressions to be evaluated are placed within
two C<%%>.

Evaluation takes place within an environment in which, for example,
you can place data structures which will serve to generate the
parts to be completed.


             TEMPLATE
           Text + Perl Expression 
                |
                +-----> Evaluation ----> Text(document or program)
                |
           Subs + Data structures
            ENVIRONMENT

The C<Parse::Template> class permits decomposing a template into
parts.  These parts are defined by a hash passed as an argument to the
class constructor:
C<Parse::Template->E<gt>C<new('someKey', '... text with expressions to
evaluate ...')>.  Within a part, a sub-part can beincluded by means of
an expression of the form:

  $self->eval('SUB_PART_NAME')

C<$self> designates the instance of the C<Parse::Template> class.
In an expression you can also use the C<$part> which contains the
part of the template where the expression is found.

Within an expression it is possible to specify only the name of a part
to be inserted.  In this case a subroutine with the name of this part
is generated dynamically.  In the example given in the synopsis, the
insertion of the C<TOP> part can thus be rewritten as follows:

  'TOP' => q!Text before %%DATA()%% text after!

C<DATA()> is placed within C<%%> and is in effect treated as an
expression to be evaluated.

The subroutines take arguments.  In the following example,
the argument is used to control the depth of recursive calls
of a template:

  print Parse::Template->new(
    'TOP' => q!%%$_[0] < 10 ? '[' . TOP($_[0] + 1) . ']' : ''%%!
   )->eval('TOP', 0);

C<$_[0]> initially contains 0. C<TOP> is included as long as the
argument is less than 10.  For each inclusion, 1 is added to the argument.

The C<env()> method permits constructing the environment required for
evaluation of a template.  Each entry to be defined within this
environment must be specified using a key consisting of the name of
the symbol to be created, associated with a reference whose type is
that of the entry to be created within this environment (for example,
a reference to an array to create an array).  A scalar variable is
defined by associating the name of the variable with its value.  A
scalar variable containing a reference is defined by writing
C<'var'=>E<gt>C<\$variable>, where C<$variable> is a lexical variable
that contains the reference.

Each instance of C<Parse::Template> is defined within a specific class,
a subclass of C<Parse::Template>.  The subclass contains the environment
specific to the template and inherits methods from the C<Parse::Template>
class.

In case of a syntax error in the evalutaion of an expression,
C<Parse::Template> tries to indicate the template part and the
expression that is "incriminated".  If the variable
C<$Parse::Template::CONFESS> contains the value TRUE, the stack
of evaluations is printed.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new HASH

Constructor for the class. C<HASH> is a hash which defines the
template text.

Example:

 use Parse::Template;
 $t = new Parse::Template('key' => 'associated text');

=item env HASH

=item env SYMBOL

Permits defining the environment that is specific to a template.

C<env(SYMBOL)> returns the reference associated with the symbol, or
C<undef> if the symbol is not defined.  The reference that is returned
is of the type indicated by the character (C<&, $, %, @, *>) that
prefixes the symbol.

Examples:

  $tmplt->env('LIST' => [1, 2, 3])}   Defines a list

  @{$tmplt->env('*LIST')}             Returns the list

  @{$tmplt->env('@LIST')}             Ditto


=item eval PART_NAME

Evaluates the template part designated by C<PART_NAME>.  Returns the
string resulting from this evaluation.

=item getPart PART_NAME

Returns the designated part of the template.

=item ppregexp REGEXP

Preprocesses a regular expression so that it can be inserted into a
template where the regular expression delimiter is either a "/" or a
"!".

=item setPart PART_NAME => TEXT

C<setPart()> permits defining a new entry in the hash that defines the
contents of the template.

=head1 EXAMPLES


The C<Parse::Template> class can be used in all sorts of amusing
ways. Here are a few illustrations.

The first example shows how to generate an HTML document by using a
data structure placed within the evaluation environment.  The template
consists of two parts, C<DOC> and C<SECTION>.  The C<SECTION> part is
called within the C<DOC> part to generate as many sections as there are
elements in the array C<section_content>.

 my %template = ('DOC' => <<'END_OF_DOC;', 'SECTION' => <<'END_OF_SECTION;');
 <html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
 %%
 my $content;
 for (my $i = 0; $i <= $#section_content; $i++) {
   $content .= SECTION($i);
 }
 $content;
 %%
 </body>
 </html>
 END_OF_DOC;
 %%
 $section_content[$_[0]]->{Content} =~ s/^/<p>/mg;
 join '', '<H1>', $section_content[$_[0]]->{Title}, '</H1>', $section_content[$_[0]]->{Content};
 %%
 END_OF_SECTION;

 my $tmplt = new Parse::Template (%template);

 $tmplt->env('section_content' => [
     {
      Title => 'First Section',
      Content => 'Nothing to declare'
     },
     {
      Title => 'Second section',
      Content => 'Nothing else to declare'
     }
    ]
     );

 print $tmplt->eval('DOC'), "\n";

The second example shows how to generate an HTML document using a
functional notation, in other words, obtaining the text:

 <P><B>text in bold</B><I>text in italic</I></P>

from

 P(B("text in bold"), I("text in italic"))


The Perl expression that permits producing the content of an element is
very simple, and reduces to:

 join '', @_

The content to be evaluated is the same regardless of the tag and can
therefore be placed within a variable.  We therefore obtain the
following template:

 my $ELT_CONTENT = q!%%join '', @_%%!;
 my $HTML_T1 = new Parse::Template(
       'DOC' => '%%P(B("text in bold"), I("text in italic"))%%',
       'P' => qq!<P>$ELT_CONTENT</P>!,
       'B' => qq!<B>$ELT_CONTENT</B>!,
       'I' => qq!<I>$ELT_CONTENT</I>!,
      );
 print $HTML_T1->eval('DOC'), "\n";

We can go further by making use of the C<$part> variable, which
is defined by default in the environment of evaluation of the template:

 $ELT_CONTENT = q!%%"<$part>" . join('', @_) . "</$part>"%%!;
 $HTML_T2 = new Parse::Template(
       'DOC' => '%%P(B("text in bold"), I("text in italic"))%%',
       'P' => qq!$ELT_CONTENT!,
       'B' => qq!$ELT_CONTENT!,
       'I' => qq!$ELT_CONTENT!,
      );
 print $HTML_T2->eval('DOC'), "\n";


Let's look at another step which automates the production of 
expressions from the list of HTML tags which are of interest to us:

 $DOC = q!P(B("text in bold"), I("text in italic"))!;

 $ELT_CONTENT = q!%%"<$part>" . join('', @_) . "</$part>"%%!;
 $HTML_T3 = new Parse::Template(
      'DOC' => qq!%%$DOC%%!,
      map { $_ => $ELT_CONTENT } qw(P B I)
     );
 print $HTML_T3->eval('DOC'), "\n";


With a slight transformation it is possible to use a 
method-invocation notation:

 $ELT_CONTENT = q!%%shift(@_); "<$part>" . join('', @_) . "</$part>"%%!;
 $HTML_T4 = new Parse::Template(
      map { $_ => $ELT_CONTENT } qw(P B I)
     );
 print $HTML_T4->P(
                   $HTML_T4->B("text in bold"),
                   $HTML_T4->I("text in italic")
                  ), "\n";

The C<shift(@_)> permits getting rid of the template object, which
we don't need within the expression.

C<Parse::Template> was initially created to serve as a code generator
for the C<Parse::Lex> class.  You will find other examples of its use
in the classes C<Parse::Lex>, C<Parse::CLex> and C<Parse::Token>.
