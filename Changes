VERSION 2.20 - 2010-03-25

o Bump version to 3.00, to be higher than the last ParseLex version that had it own (older)
  version of Parse::Template (2.18).  This older version does not compile in Perl 5.11
  due to the usage of a deprecated feature : 
    Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is deprecated
  A new ParseLex will be uploaded without the older Parse::Template inside, and with a 
  dependency to this Parse::Template instead.
o Updated the existing English translation of the POD from the older version, replaced
  the French POD by the English one.
o Minor changes due to warnings.

VERSION 0.37 - ???

o Last version published by the original author, Philippe Verdret.
