	Bug Fixes
	* Bump version to 3.00, to be higher than the last ParseLex version that 
	  had it own (older) version of Parse::Template (2.18).
	  This older version does not compile in Perl 5.11 due to the usage of a
	  deprecated feature : Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is deprecated
	  A new ParseLex will be uploaded without the older Parse::Template inside, and with a 
	  dependency to this Parse::Template instead.
	* Updated the existing English translation of the POD from the older version, replaced
	  the French POD by the English one.
	* Minor changes due to warnings.
