  Bareword "done_testing" not allowed while "strict subs" in use

VERSION 3.05 - 2010-08-14

o Test FAIL ParseTemplate-3.04 v5.6.2 Linux due to different error message

VERSION 3.02 - 2010-03-26

o Solve RT #55977 (parse::template should not be part of parselex)
o Bump version number to force re-index after new ParseLex was uploaded without Parse::Template

VERSION 3.01 - 2010-03-26

o Ignore whitespace in the comparison run in the tests, to avoid tests breaking caused by
  blanks at the end of result lines or CR-LF vs LF differences.
o Add -Iblib/lib to all test program executions, so that our library is used in the test;
  otherwise tests fail if Parse::Template is not already installed in the machine

VERSION 3.00 - 2010-03-25

o Bump version to 3.00, to be higher than the last ParseLex version that had it own (older)
  version of Parse::Template (2.18).  This older version does not compile in Perl 5.11
  due to the usage of a deprecated feature : 
    Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method %s() is deprecated
  A new ParseLex will be uploaded without the older Parse::Template inside, and with a 
  dependency to this Parse::Template instead.
o Updated the existing English translation of the POD from the older version, replaced
  the French POD by the English one.
o Minor changes due to warnings.

VERSION 0.37 - 2001-06-13

o Last version published by the original author, Philippe Verdret.
